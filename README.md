# Cryptography Midterm - RSA
## Created by Brock Weekley and Evan Buchanan

This project was generated using CMAKE and Xcode on macOS 12 and utilizes the GMP library.

To build the project, the file rsa.cpp can be compiled using standard g++ compilers or with CMAKE.

If you are compiling with g++ or a similar compilier, you will need to link the GMP library in your compile command.

If you are using xcode and CMAKE, you will need to manually link your instillation of the GMP library in the Build settings of xcode.

The provided CMakeLists.txt file will generate the CMake project with the "cmake ." command.

This command generates a project for whatever platform you run the program on. It also takes arguments
for specific build types, such as xcode "cmake . -G xcode".


rsa.cpp contains the entire algorithm and project. Files generated by the program are output to 
program_files/ and input from the same if automatic input is selected.

There are three constants at the top of this file:

- K, which defines the size of N in bits

- PADDING, which defines if the program is to use Message Padding Scheme 1.5 or not

- AUTO, which defines if the program should auto generate p, q, and e or if they should be input



All other files are for opening and building the project in xcode or with CMAKE.
